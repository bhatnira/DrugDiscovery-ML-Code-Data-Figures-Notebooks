### Code Contributions

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the coding standards (see below)
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
```bash
pytest tests/
```

4. **Commit your changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: descriptive commit message"
```

5. **Push and create pull request**
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Coding Standards

- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Code Formatting**: Use `black` for code formatting
- **Import Sorting**: Use `isort` for import organization
- **Linting**: Use `flake8` for code quality checks
- **Documentation**: Add docstrings for all functions and classes

**Format your code:**
```bash
black .
isort .
flake8 .
```

#### Notebook Guidelines

- **Clear Structure**: Use markdown cells to explain each section
- **Reproducible**: Set random seeds for reproducibility
- **Clean Output**: Clear outputs before committing
- **Documentation**: Add comments explaining complex logic

### Adding New Models

When adding new machine learning models:

1. **Create a new notebook** following the naming convention
2. **Include comprehensive evaluation** (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC)
3. **Add model interpretation** where possible (SHAP, feature importance)
4. **Document the methodology** in markdown cells
5. **Compare with existing models** if applicable

### Adding New Molecular Descriptors

For new molecular descriptor implementations:

1. **Research validation**: Ensure the descriptor is scientifically sound
2. **Performance comparison**: Compare with existing descriptors
3. **Documentation**: Explain the descriptor calculation method
4. **Code efficiency**: Optimize for computational performance

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=.

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functions
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies when necessary

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include parameter types and return values
- Add usage examples where helpful

### Notebook Documentation

- Use markdown cells to explain methodology
- Include literature references
- Add interpretation of results
- Explain parameter choices
